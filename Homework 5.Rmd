## From Instructions

```{r}
library(car)
data(Wong)
library(dplyr)
# add an age group variable
Wong$agegrp <- case_when(
  (Wong$age > 0 & Wong$age <= 10) ~ 1,
  (Wong$age > 10 & Wong$age <= 20) ~ 2,
  (Wong$age > 20 & Wong$age <= 30) ~ 3,
  (Wong$age > 30 & Wong$age <= 40) ~ 4,
  (Wong$age > 40 & Wong$age <= 50) ~ 5,
  (Wong$age > 50 & Wong$age <= 60) ~ 6,
  (Wong$age > 60 & Wong$age <= 70) ~ 7,
  (Wong$age > 70 & Wong$age <= 100) ~ 8)

# convert to factor, add code levels and labels
Wong$agegrp <- factor(Wong$agegrp,
                  levels = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8),
                  labels = c("Ages 1-10",
                             "Ages 11-10",
                             "Ages 21-10",
                             "Ages 31-10",
                             "Ages 41-10",
                             "Ages 51-10",
                             "Ages 61-70",
                             "Ages 71-100"))

```

## 1
Make a table of non-parametric statistics (median and IQR) for the number of days and duration grouped by `sex`. You'll be using `summarise()` from the `dplyr` package. For a given variable `x` you'll use `median(x, na.rm=TRUE)`, `quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE)`, and `quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE)`. Give the table a title using the `caption=` option and update the column names with something nice using the `col.names=` option in the `knitr::kable()` command. 

```{r}

```


##2
Make a table of parametric statistics (mean and SD) for the performance outcomes `piq` and `viq` grouped by `sex`. Like the table above, you'll be using `summarise()` from the `dplyr` package. Now you'll use `mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)` and `sd(x, na.rm=TRUE)`. Give the table a title using the `caption=` option and update the column names with something nice using the `col.names=` option in the `knitr::kable()` command.

```{r}

```


##3
Make a table containing the frequencies and relative percentages for `agegrp`. Use the example we did in class to help guide you.

```{r}

```

##4
Make a regression model (Model 1) for the performance IQ (`piq`) using `age` and `sex`. Put the regression model results into a table.

```{r}

```
 
##5
Make a second regression model (Model 2) for performance IQ (`piq`) using `age` and `sex` plus `days` and `duration`. Put the regression model results into a table.

```{r}

```

##6
Finally, make a table showing the results from the `anova()` command comparing Model 1 and Model 2 you made above using the example we did in class as a guide. 

```{r}

```


##7
STUDENT CHOICE - pick either a `htmlwidget` from [http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) or do a "flexdashboard" using the templates at [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) as a guide.

```{r}

```
